Three assignments. 
For assignment1 and assignment2 except the last one(I choosed the tensorflow), I worked in my laptop. python 2.7
The tensorflow.ipynb in assignment2, I worked in my station with Ubuntu16.04 LTS, a GPU Nvidia 980Ti and tensorflow version is 1.2.0-rc0 GPU only(before tensorflow version is 0.9.0 and some API is too old that they cannot work) cudnn5.1+cuda8.0.
